"""
Bridge to the Knowledge Recommendation Agent.

Wraps the FAISS-based RAG retriever that lives in the `rag/` folder so
the support-assistance pipeline (Task 6) can ground its response
suggestions in the customer-support knowledge base.

The import is lazy and fully guarded: if the vector database, the
embedding model or any dependency is unavailable, the bridge degrades
gracefully and returns an empty result list instead of breaking the
support API.

# and escalation analysis stay grounded in contextually relevant
# information (e.g. delayed_order -> delivery/order docs, never
# payment_issues.txt).
#
# Sources are matched against the ``source`` field in each chunk's
# metadata (the filename the RAG chunker stored). A source is
# considered relevant if its name contains any of the keywords listed
# for the intent. ``general_inquiry`` has no restriction (all sources

# to the detected intent's topic, so the suggested response,
# coaching tips and escalation analysis can only quote passages
# about the customer's actual issue.
#
# Rules:
# - ``general_inquiry`` derives its vocabulary from the customer's
#   OWN message (topic unknown until the customer reveals it); if the
#   message carries no topic words, no knowledge is returned at all.
# - The customer's own words can widen retrieval: if the message
#   itself explicitly asks about a refund/payment while the intent
#   is another topic (e.g. delayed_order + "or I want my money
#   back"), the refund/payment content words are additionally
#   allowed — the customer IS asking about it.
