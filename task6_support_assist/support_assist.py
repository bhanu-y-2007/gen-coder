"""
Support Assistance Module (Task 6).

Implements the two agents required by the task:

1. CoachingResponseAgent  - Coaching & Response Suggestion Agent
   - Generates context-aware suggested responses for support agents
     using customer intent, sentiment, conversation history and
     knowledge-base results.
   - Evaluates suggested responses for tone, clarity, empathy and
     professionalism.
   - Provides actionable communication improvement tips.

2. EscalationRiskMonitor  - Escalation Risk Monitor Agent
   - Continuously monitors the conversation and calculates an
     escalation-risk score (0-100) after every customer message.
   - Identifies indicators such as repeated complaints, high
     frustration, negative sentiment, unresolved issues and requests
     for a supervisor.
   - Classifies conversations into Low / Medium / High / Critical
     risk levels and provides the reasoning for the score.
   - Raises a configurable alert when the high-escalation threshold
     is reached and recommends appropriate actions.

Both agents are deterministic rule-based implementations (no external
LLM call required) so they always respond in real time.
